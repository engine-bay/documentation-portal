# Actor Engine

## Overview

The [EngineBay.ActorEngine](https://github.com/engine-bay/actor-engine) provides the runtime for converting the Blueprints in a Workbook into an executable function. This is the core of the rules and calculations engine based on the [Actor Model](https://proto.actor/).

Under the hood, it leverages the [Proto.Actor .Net framework](https://github.com/asynkron/protoactor-dotnet). You can find out more about this in the [Actor Model](../../about/architecture-decision-records/actor-model.md) and [Proto.actor](../../about/architecture-decision-records/proto-actor.md) architecture decision records.
