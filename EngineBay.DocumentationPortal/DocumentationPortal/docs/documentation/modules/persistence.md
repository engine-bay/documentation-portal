# Persistence

## Overview

The [EngineBay.Persistence](https://github.com/engine-bay/persistence) provides the common mechanisms for reading and writing data to multiple relational database storage providers.

The underlying implementation is based on [Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/). You can find out more about this in the [Multiple Database Providers](../../about/architecture-decision-records/multiple-database-providers.md) and [CQRS](../../about/architecture-decision-records/cqrs.md) architecture decision records.

See the [Database Configuration](../configuration//environment-variables.md#database) for more details on configuring the database provider of your choice.
