# Configuration

EngineBay is configured through [Environment Variables](./environment-variables.md).

EngineBay is not intended to be pre-configured with any workbooks, blueprints etc. however, it is convenient for testing purposes to have a deterministic state. See the [Seed Data](./seed-data.md) for more details on how to insert data on startup.
